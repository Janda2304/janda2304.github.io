  <h1 class="title">Training Grounds</h1>
  <p class="main-text">The Training Grounds, formerly known as the Tutorial Map,
    is a crucial location within the realm of Romardia, <br>
    Under the ownership and guidance of Eldin the Wise
    this strategic arena serves as a dummy fortress where aspiring guardians of Romardia embark on their journey
    to master the fundamentals of the game.<br>
  </p>
  <h2 class="main-text"><b>Features</b></h2>
  <p>The Training Grounds provide a comprehensive and structured environment for players to learn the essential
    mechanics and strategies of Fortress Guardian
  </p>
  <p class="main-text">Training Grounds

    <br> <br>
    <b>Owned by Eldin the Wise: </b> As a respected and venerable figure within the realm of Romardia, Eldin the Wise oversees the Training Grounds, offering sage advice and guidance to novice guardians as they undertake their training.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Dummy Fortress: </b> Designed to simulate the experience of defending a fortress against waves of enemies, the Training Grounds serve as a training ground where players can hone their skills and refine their strategies in a controlled environment.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Five Waves: </b> To provide a structured learning experience, the Training Grounds consist of five waves of enemy attacks, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity. This incremental progression allows players to familiarize themselves with the game's mechanics at their own pace, building confidence and mastery over time.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Learning Fundamentals: </b> The Training Grounds are specifically tailored to teach players the fundamental concepts of Fortress Guardian, including tower placement, resource management, enemy behavior, and strategic decision-making. Through hands-on experience and guided tutorials, players develop the skills necessary to succeed in more challenging battles.
    <br> <br>
    <b> Limited Enemy Variety:</b>In order to streamline the learning process, the Training Grounds feature a restricted selection of enemies, consisting primarily of goblins and bears. By focusing on these two enemy types, players can study their behaviors and vulnerabilities in detail, preparing them for encounters with more diverse adversaries in later stages of the game.
    <br><br>
    <b> Development History </b> <br>
    Originally designated as the "Tutorial Map," the Training Grounds underwent significant evolution during the development of Fortress Guardian:
    <br><br>
    <b>Name Change: </b> In dev0.11, the map's name was changed from "Tutorial Map" to "Training Grounds," reflecting its broader role as a dedicated training arena rather than a simple tutorial environment.
    <br><br>
    <b>Size Adjustment: </b> Throughout the development process, the size of the Training Grounds underwent several revisions, most notably increasing the size four times with the implementation of the new fortress building. This expansion allowed for greater flexibility in level design and gameplay mechanics, enriching the training experience for players.
    <br><br> <br>
    Despite its humble origins as a tutorial environment, the Training Grounds have emerged as a cornerstone of Fortress Guardian, providing aspiring guardians with the knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to defend the realm of Romardia against the forces of darkness. Under the watchful guidance of Eldin the Wise, players embark on a journey of discovery and mastery, preparing themselves for the epic battles that await on the front lines of defense.</p>
